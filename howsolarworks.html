<h2>Solar panel</h2>
<p>The term solar panel is used colloquially for a photo-voltaic. A photo-voltaic module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation. Photo-voltaic cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. A collection of photo-voltaic modules is a called a PV Panel and a system of panels in an array. Arrays of photo-voltaic system supply solar electricity to electrical equipment. The most common application of solar enegy collection outside agriculture is solar water heating systems.</p>

<h2>Charge controller</h2>
<p>A charge controller limits the rate at which electic current is added to or drawn from electirc batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining a battery or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life. The term "charge controller" may refer to either a stand-alone device or to control circuitry integrated within a battery-powerd device or battery charger.</p>

<article class="article art3">
<h2>Battery system</h2>
<p>Battery system is an electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery, such as by protecting the battery from operating outside of it's safe operating area, monitorting it's state, calculating secondary data, reporting data, controlling it's environment, authenticating and or balancing it.</p>

<article class="article art4">
<h2>DC power</h2>
<p>Direct current is the one directional or undiractional flow of electril charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor, such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators or even through a vaccum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current. DC has many uses, from the charging of batteries to large power supplies for electronic systems, motors and more. Very large quantities of electrical energy provided via DC are used in smelting of aluminium and other electrochemical processes.</p>

<article class="article art5">
<h2>Inverter</h2>
<p>An inverter is a power electronic devide or circuitry that changes direct current to alternating current. The input voltage, output voltage, frequency and the overall power handling depend on the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power, the power is provided by the DC source. An inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process. Inverters are primarily used in electrical power application where high currents and voltages are present; circuits that perform the same function for electronic signals, which usually have very low currents and voltages, are called oscillators. Circuits that perform the opposite function, converting AC to DC, are called rectifiers.

<article class="article art6">
<h2>AC power</h2>
<p>Alternating current is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current, which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave, whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information such as sound or images carried by modulation of an AC carrier signal.</p>
